xelpaste is a Django based pastebin. It's intended to run separately but its also
possible to be installed into an existing Django project like a regular app.

You can find a live example on http://xelpaste.org/; it is based upon the "dpaste" project.

Further documentation can be found here: http://dpaste.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
